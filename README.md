# Big-Basket-Delivery-Slots
This is a small utility script written to automate the process and notify you when a Big Basket delivery slot becomes available! 

## How to execute the script
This script uses python 3+.
1) Checkout the repo 
2) Run `pip install -r requirements`
3) Run `chromedriver-path` script to check where your `chromedriver` is installed. Update the path in the code if required. 


## How to proceed further
1) Make sure your basket is already prepared.
2) A popup opens the first time script is executed. Go to the login tab and login to your account.(Make sure the correct address is selected!)
4) Once a slot becomes available, an OSX notification will pop up.


Please star the repo if you find the script useful!

(I saw this idea for Amazon US and Whole Foods in this repo https://github.com/pcomputo/Whole-Foods-Delivery-Slot and decided to do the same for BigBasket, India.)
